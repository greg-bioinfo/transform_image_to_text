At first the program "detection_word.py" detects the presence of words thanks to a mask and extract them.
Then the program "detection_letter.py" detects the letters from the words detected and extract them.

The program "dataset_font.py" create a dataset with all lowercase and uppercase letters in multiple fonts.
